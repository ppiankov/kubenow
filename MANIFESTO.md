# Attention-First Software

Modern software increasingly treats user attention as a resource to be extracted rather than protected.

Interfaces interrupt users with promotions, upsells, notifications, and "engagement" mechanics while failing to make core tasks fast, clear, and reliable. The result is not better products, but chronic cognitive fatigue.

We reject this approach.

**The primary responsibility of software is to disappear once it works correctly.**

Good software:
- makes the common path effortless
- removes the need for constant interpretation
- does not require users to "stay alert" to use it safely
- minimizes decisions instead of multiplying them
- completes the task and gets out of the way

If a user is trying to pay a bill, the software should help them pay the bill — not compete for their attention with unrelated incentives.

If a system requires continuous focus to avoid mistakes, the system is poorly designed.

**We believe attention is a finite, non-renewable resource in the moment.**
Wasting it is not a neutral act.

Software should reduce cognitive load, not monetize it.
Precision, clarity, and restraint are features.

The best software is not the one users notice the most.
It is the one they stop noticing entirely.
